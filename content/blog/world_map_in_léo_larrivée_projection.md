This world map shows each country as a polygon based on Natural Earth data, where each country is coloured based on its distance from the equator.

This rather unusual shape is because I used the Larrivee Projection here, which was developed by Léo Larrivée in 1988 for the Canadian International Development Agency. So far, I could only figure  out that it was most likely used for remote sensing, so if you know more about the science behind this distinctive design, let us know!
