In this mini project, I used Sentinel satellite images to create an animation on the changes in Upsala Glacier, Argentina, for several years.

In my outdoors map I combined the effort of visualising climate change and the new, quite grandiose update of ESA's Sentinel data availability by creating this animation of Upsala Glacier, Argentina. The footage is built based on querying the least cloudy true-colour image of each half-year from 2016 up until today.   𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐬: https://www.patreon.com/milanjanosov
