What will be the greatest trends in data science for this year? My annual survey question from the GPT engine.

“What will be the biggest data science trends in 2023?”

First of all, why would I ask artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, a question about data science? Well, there are several personal reasons. Since my undergraduate years of studying physics, I have been deeply fond of Isaac Asimov and his Foundation series. Later, as I did my PhD in data science, I realized how close data science and Asimov’s psychohistory actually are—using quantitative tools to understand and forecast human behavior at scale!

This fascination led to a language analytics language processing research project where I dealt with Asimov’s books as a stream of textual data in 2021. As Asimov also contributed significantly to the principles of robotics, it was an appropriate gesture to incorporate this fancy new tool called “GPT-3” by OpenAI—a text completion engine. GPT-3 was already trained on a vast amount of text produced by humans and performed reasonably well at completing entire paragraphs based on as little as a single sentence. So I added a few paragraphs of GPT-3’s text to the research paper. Those paragraphs worked fairly well in the text, but honestly, did not add too much novelty.

A few months after, as the new year of 2022 kicked in, I went to the OpenAI platform again and asked GPT-3 about the major trends of data science for the new year. On the one hand, these prediction sentences worked quite well. On the other hand, they were very vague and generic, and closer to horoscopes than actual forecasts. For example, the points were outlined in brief sentences, not elaborated paragraphs, and they were generic enough that some points were even slightly inconsistent with each other.

So after all this, I was very curious to see the new fuss around the latest tool of OpenAI, ChatGPT. At first glance, this chatbot really knows something! Passing medical and law school final exams, generating pretty color palettes, and so many more applications. In early 2023, I followed my tradition and asked the AI bot the big question again:
