Building and visualizing the alumni relations of the Central European University.

<!--more-->

CEU has a community of almost 15,000 alumni from more than 130 countries from around the world. This visualization shows their network: the nodes represent the alumni, and the links between them express their similarity. Their similarity, the weight of the links, is one, if the end nodes share only one of the following attributes: citizenship, year of graduation, and program. If they have two of these arguments in common, the strength of their connection is two. In case they all match, the tie strength is three. The visualization contains a 10% random sample of the alumni community and only nationalities exceeding 1% of the sample are colored and named.


I am grateful for the CEU Alumni Relations office for their help in making this project possible.
