For the topic North is not Always Up in the #30DayMapChallenge, I visualized the global magnetic field, showing how the magnetic poles diverge from the geographical ones.


I have wrestled a lot with this piece, both in terms of topic and visuals. In the end, I defaulted to my background in Physics and decided to draw up the Earth's magnetic field with its Main Field Declination lines. These lines, as magnetic poles, can either be positive or negative. The Earth's magnetic north pole is defined by these lines - which is not always up. Its moving! In recent years, it started migrating from the Canadian Arctic towards Russia at a speed of several kilometres per year.
