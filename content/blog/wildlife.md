Combining geospatial data science, network science, and the unique wildlife habitat database of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) supports wildlife protection policy making.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) launched a number of different projects aiming to protect wildlife. One of these efforts led to a high-quality global geospatial database containing the habitats of more than 100,000 species. In this article, I explore how species of the mammal class are related to each other based on their shared habitats. To achieve this, I combined a handful of tools from geospatial analytics and network science to transform the geographical areas of habitats into a relational graph of animal species.
