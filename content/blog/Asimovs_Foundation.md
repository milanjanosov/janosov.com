Isaac Asimov's Foundation series is widely considered to be the best science fiction novel series ever written. The first books are centered on the mathematician Hari Seldon, who discovers a way to predict the future, called psychohistory, baring quite a few mutual traits to today’s data science. With the help of this new scientific field, Seldon founded the Foundations – two groups of scientists and engineers – whose purpose was to preserve and maintain human civilization across the galaxy and its countless inhabited worlds.

Earlier research quantified different dimensions of the book industry from various angles, such as understanding the broader evolution of culture, uncovering the hidden formula behind bestsellers, and capturing the key factors of individual career success. Following this line of work, we first highlight the significance of Foundation in Asimov’s career based on the data available on Goodreads. As such, we construct a time series representation of his career history which enables us to analyze the evolution of his career success over time as shown in the following and in an interactive visualization below.


After pinpointing the overall importance of Foundation in Asimov's career, we aim to understand several quantitative characteristics of the novel series itself using language processing and network science. Namely, we study the Foundation series as a set of textual data and discuss elementary statistical aspects, such as the world-frequency distribution and differences between separate books. Then we focus on sentiment analysis and temporal patterns to curate the emotional arcs of Asimov's worlds (different extrasolar planets of the sci-fi series). In the last part of the analysis, we tame the relatedness of Asimov's worlds by constructing a network of worlds connected by semantic similarities - mutually co-mentioned words, providing a network view and descriptive statistics of Asimov's universe. The interactive network can be explored below and on the next figure.
