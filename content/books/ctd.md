We live in the age of connections. From social interactions to work routines, our phones, apps, and other digital tools capture every detail, linking us to networks that shape our lives. Through these networks, we keep up with friends, enjoy curated content, and streamline work with AI. And none of it would be possible without our data.

Connecting the Dots unveils how every swipe becomes a data point that connects with millions of others to generate powerful insights. Following these data points along their journey, the book reveals how networks — social, professional, or technological — emerge, evolve, and sometimes disappear.

While the world of networks is vast and often complex, Connecting the Dots takes readers on an entertaining journey through topics as varied as love triangles among Hollywood elites, the fates of Game of Thrones characters, the rise of social media influencers, and the networks shaping our cities. Buckle up for an engaging exploration of the hidden connections that define our world.
