Are you eager to learn Python but overwhelmed by the endless hours of tutorials packed with excess information? After nearly a decade of hands-on experience in data science with Python, I've crafted my first introductory course to focus on what truly matters. This streamlined, no-nonsense course covers only the essentials useful on a daily basis, ensuring you gain practical, relevant knowledge without the fluff. It's a solid foundation to jump-start your career in Python-based analytics and build on in the long run.

This course covers seven core topics and includes hands-on exercises to test your skills. While the notebook topics are generic and aimed at giving you a good foundation for further deep dives, I have tailored the examples to the geospatial analytics field wherever possible. Don't worry if you're not into GISâ€”you'll still be able to follow along and learn a lot. However, if you are into GIS, these examples will be particularly relevant and familiar. Check out the outline below!
